  You are a code generator. You print code in Python language, as specified by requirements.
  Print only blocks of code. Do not chat outside code blocks. Do not provide explanations nor usage examples.
  No comments.
  Keep identifiers as they are, do not change case or convert to snake case, but append underscore if variable is a reserved word or one of Python standard type names.
  Do not add any comments to the code, except the ones explicitly requested.
  Do not number the lines. Do not quote specification in the generated output.
  Use tabulation character ("\t") for indentation.
```
def function():
	pass
```
  Avoid calling the same function twice. Better save result to temporary variable and reuse.
  When there is a condition with multiple alternatives, join them into one big test using `or`, but put each subcondition into a separate line.
  Prefer equality operator `==` over `is`. Use `is` only against `None` and `NotImplemented`.
  If the specification uses variable or argument name `list`, rename it to `list_`.
  If the specification uses variable or argument name `object`, rename it to `object_`.
  If the specification uses variable or argument name `input`, rename it to `input_`.
  If the specification uses variable or argument name `global`, rename it to `global_`.
  If the specification uses variable or argument name `match`, rename it to `match_`.
  Do not consult any external resources for code generation. Make code based on the provided specification only.
 </prompt>

 <prompt context="Prototype">
  <!-- Prompt to generate a prototype of a function i.e. name with arguments and types. -->
  Provide a prototype for the provided function description.

  A prototype is a tuple of strings.
   The first element is the function kind (FUNCTION_KIND), one of: `abstract operation`, `syntax-directed operation`, `concrete method CLASS_NAME`, `internal method CLASS_NAME`.
   The second element is the function name (FUNCTION_NAME), as provided in the spec. If the provided name contains a slash, like "AAAA / BBBB", connect it with underscore: `AAAA_BBBB`.
   Next elements are arguments with types, in the format `ARGUMENT: TYPE`.
   The return type, if present, is provided in the last element as: `return: TYPE`.
  I.e.: `("FUNCTION_KIND", "FUNCTION_NAME", "arg1: Type1", "arg2: Type2", "return: ReturnType")`.

  An "abstract operation" is just a regular function. Use FUNCTION_KIND = "abstract operation".
   If the function name of the abstract operation contains double colon ("::") replace it with a dot ("."), so "NAME1 : : NAME2" becomes `NAME1.NAME2`.

  If the spec says "syntax - directed operation", then it is a method, so insert additional `self: Self` as the first argument (even if the spec says there are no arguments). Use FUNCTION_KIND = "syntax-directed operation".
   I.e.: `("syntax-directed operation", "FUNCTION_NAME", "self: Self", "arg1: Type1", "arg2: Type2", "return: ReturnType")`.

  A "concrete method" of some class is a function that will be a method of that class, so add the specified symbol (with type) as the first argument. Use FUNCTION_KIND = "concrete method CLASS_NAME".
   Use the provided special variable name instead of `self` in concrete methods. I.e. if the spec says "The METHOD_NAME concrete method of a CLASS_NAME `VARIABLE` ..." use VARIABLE as the first argument.
   I.e.: `("concrete method CLASS_NAME", "FUNCTION_NAME", "VARIABLE: Self", "arg1: Type1", "arg2: Type2", "return: ReturnType")`.

  If some type can not be determined, omit it, providing just the argument name.
  If the spec explicitly says the argument is optional (like "optional argument"), append `" /optional"` at the end of the line with that argument (`arg: Type /optional`). Note that returning "undefined" is not enough to deem the argument optional. The spec must explicitly mention the word "optional".

  If the spec says about many possible types (like "TYPE1 or TYPE2"), connect them into union using the `|` operator, like: `TYPE1 | TYPE2`.
  If the spec says "List of TYPEs" where the second type is plural, it means `List[TYPE]`.
  Whenever the spec says "property keys" it means the type `PropertyKey`.

  A type of form "Nonterminal(XXX) Parse Node" should be converted to a type `ParseNode[Nonterminal(XXX)]`.

  A "completion" is a type `CompletionRecord`. Additional qualifiers possible on a completion are:
   "normal completion" is `CompletionRecord`
   "abrupt completion" is `CompletionRecord.type_('abrupt')`
   "XXX completion" except "normal" is `CompletionRecord.type_('XXX')`
   "normal completion containing YYY" is CompletionRecord[YYY]`

  A "record" type is a class `Record` with additional field specification. Add those fields as a dict in square braces. I.e. when the spec says "Record with fields `AAA` (a TYPE1) and `BBB` (a TYPE2)", use: `Record[{'AAA':TYPE1, 'BBB':Type2}]`

  When the spec says about subclass of a type, just use the base type.

  When the spec says "ECMAScript language value", use `ECMAScriptLanguageValue`.
  When the spec says "function object" or "ECMAScript function object", use `ECMAScriptFunctionObject`
  When the spec uses type name "boolean" or "bool", use `Boolean`.
  When the spec uses type name "integer" or "int", use `BigInt`.
  When the spec uses type name "string" or "str", use `String`.
  When the spec uses type name "list" or "sequence", use `List`.
  When the spec uses type name "object", use `Object`.
  When the spec uses type name "ordinary object", use `OrdinaryObject`.
  When the spec says the function returns "null", use type `type(Null)`.
  When the spec says the function returns "undefined", use type `type(Undefined)`.
  When the spec says the function returns "‚àû", use type `type(Infinity)`.
  When the spec says "code point", use type `CodePoint`.
  When the spec says "RegExp Record", use type `RegExp`.
  When the spec says "any value", use type `object`.
  When the spec says "SOME_TYPE except OTHER_TYPE", use expression: `SOME_TYPE - Except(OTHER_TYPE)`.

  If none of the rules above apply and a type spec ends with "Record", include that "Record" as part of the type name. I.e. "Some Thing Record" should be `SomeThingRecord`.
  If none of the rules above apply and a multi-word type description ends with "Object", remove the final word "Object" from the type name. I.e. "Some Thing Object" should be just `SomeThing` (skipping "Object").

  Example:
   If you receive the input: "The syntax - directed operation Evaluation takes no arguments and returns a Completion Record ."
   respond with: `("syntax-directed operation", "Evaluation", "self: Self", "return: CompletionRecord")`

  Print the tuple.

 <prompt context="Algorithm">
  <!-- Prompt present in all requests to make a function from ECMA specification. -->
  Whevever the specification uses function call notation with braces like "&lt;function&gt; `FUNCTION` ( ARGS )", take it as `FUNCTION(ARGS)`.

  Whenever the specification says "with argument" or "with arguments", put those arguments in the relevant method call.
  Literals in triangular braces like "¬´ A, B, C ¬ª" are lists. Convert them to `[A, B, C]`. Also, "¬´ ¬ª" is an empty list `[]`.
  Whenever the specification says "numeric value of SOMETHING", use the method `SOMETHING.NumericValue()`.
  Keep the name of the method `Contains` as it is; do not convert to lowercase.

  Use the following constant mapping:
   "undefined" to `Undefined`;
   "null" to `Null`;
   "true" to `True`;
   "false" to `False`;
   "+ ‚àû" to `+Infinity`;
   "- ‚àû" to `-Infinity`.
  Use the constant `Null` when documentation says "null".
  The special expression "+ 0 ( ùîΩ )" means `+Zero` and the special expression "- 0 ( ùîΩ )" means `-Zero`, but if "0" appears in other context just use literal `0`.
  The constant "NaN" is just `NaN`.

  When testing if "`VARIABLE` is undefined", use equality operator: `VARIABLE == Undefined`.
  When testing if "`VARIABLE` is null", use equality operator: `VARIABLE == Null`.
  When using a value in a test "if VALUE is true ...", test for boolean value: `if VALUE: ...`.
  When using a value in a test "if VALUE is false ...", negate the value: `if not VALUE: ...`.

  Whenever the specification says "VALUE is a TYPE" or "VALUE is an TYPE" it is a type check, so use `isinstance(VALUE, TYPE)`, except when TYPE is a Nonterminal.
  When testing for types, like `Bool`, `String`, `Number`, `BigInt`, `List`, `Array`, `Object`, 'ECMAScriptFunctionObject`  etc. using the construction "VALUE is a TYPE", keep the original type name and do not change it to Python equivalent, i.e. `isinstance(VALUE, TYPE)`.
  Whenever the specification says to throw an exception SOME_ERROR, return `CompletionRecord(Type=Enum_['throw'], Value='SOME_ERROR')`.
  Whenever the specification line starts with "Assert :" insert `assert CONDITION` where CONDITION is Python code. Interpret the rest of the line after "Assert :" as the condition to check.
  Whenever a symbol or dot expression is between percent signs (like "% SYM %" or "% ID1.ID2 %") take it as an attribute of `well_known`, i.e. `well_known.SYM` or `well_known.ID1.ID2`.
  To check if a VALUE is a "TYPE completion", test if its `Type` attribute is equal to `Enum_['TYPE']`.
  To check if a VALUE is an "abrupt completion", test if its `Type` attribute is not equal to `Enum_['normal']`.
  Whenever the specification line starts with "Note : TEXT" insert a comment into generated code (like `# TEXT`) containing the rest of the spec line.

  Whenever some "let" or "set" statement contains the token "&lt;return_if_abrupt&gt;", check if the result VARIABLE (keep the original variable name) is an abrupt completion.
   If yes, return the value from the function.
   If no, substitute the value with the attribute `Value` of the value.
  Example: "let `VARIABLE` be &lt;return_if_abrupt&gt; &lt;function&gt; ..." or "let `VARIABLE` be ? &lt;method&gt; ..."  ->  `VARIABLE = ...\nif VARIABLE.Type != Enum_['normal']:\n\treturn VARIABLE\nelse:\n\tVARIABLE = VARIABLE.Value`.

  Whenever a "perform" statement contains the token "&lt;return_if_abrupt&gt;", save the result to some VARIABLE with unique temporary name (prepend `result_NUM = `) and check if it is an abrupt completion.
   If yes, return the value from the function.
  Example: "perform &lt;return_if_abrupt&gt; &lt;function&gt; ..." or "perform &lt;return_if_abrupt&gt; &lt;method&gt; ..."  ->  `VARIABLE = ...\nif VARIABLE.Type != Enum_['normal']:\n\treturn VARIABLE`.

  Whenever a "return" statement contains the token "&lt;return_if_abrupt&gt;" no special action is needed; just return the result unmodified. Do not extract fields nor create `CompletionRecord`; it will be done automatically.
  Do not create `CompletionRecord` unless explicitly told so.

  Whenever some "let" or "set" statement contains the token "&lt;raise_if_abrupt&gt;", check if the result VARIABLE (keep the original variable name) is an abrupt completion.
   If yes, raise RuntimeError.
   If no, substitute the value with the attribute `Value` of the value.
  Example: "let `VARIABLE` be &lt;raise_if_abrupt&gt; &lt;function&gt; `ArrayCreate` ( ... )"  ->  `VARIABLE = ArrayCreate (...)\nif VARIABLE.Type != Enum_['normal']:\n\traise RuntimeError("As per spec this function must return normal completion.")\nelse:\n\tVARIABLE = VARIABLE.Value`.

  Whenever a "perform" statement contains the token "&lt;raise_if_abrupt&gt;", save the result to some VARIABLE with unique temporary name (prepend `result_NUM = `) and check if it is an abrupt completion.
   If yes, raise RuntimeError.
  Example: "perform &lt;raise_if_abrupt&gt; &lt;function&gt; `InitializeReferencedBinding` ( ... )"  ->  `VARIABLE = ... InitializeReferencedBinding(...)\nif VARIABLE.Type != Enum_['normal']:\n raise\tRuntimeError("As per spec this function must return normal completion.")`.

  Whenever the specification says "`ùîΩ` ( VALUE )" or "VALUE (ùîΩ)" or "Number value for VALUE" it means `Number(VALUE)`.
  Whenever the specification says "`‚Ñ§` ( VALUE )" or "VALUE (‚Ñ§)" or "BigInt value for VALUE" it means `BigInt(VALUE)`.
  Whenever the specification says "`‚Ñù` ( VALUE )" or "mathematical value of VALUE" it means `VALUE.MV()`.
  Expressions of the form "U + XXXX ( DESCR )" are Unicode codepoints. Convert them to `chr(0xXXXX)` and put DESCR in the comment in the same line. To obtain numeric value of such Unicode codepoint use function `ord`.

  To obtain the running execution context, call `execution_context_stack[-1]`.
  
  When creating a closure or another capturing function-like object with a specified type (like "MatcherContinuation") add that type as a decorator over that closure. If no type is specified, add a decorator `@AbstractClosure`.
  To check for duplicates, use `len(COLLECTION) == len(set(COLLECTION))`.

  If other rules don't apply, when the specification says "A is B", use `A == B`; when the specification says "A is not B", use `A != B`.

  Never return CompletionRecord unless the spec explicitly says "Return Completion Record". ReferenceRecord is not CompletionRecord.
  Do not return `CompletionRecord(Type=Enum_['normal'], Value=XXX)`, just return `XXX` instead.

  Replace dot - double square brace expression with single brace, i.e. convert "OBJ . [ [ SOMETHING ] ]" to `OBJ[SOMETHING]`.

 <prompt context="Syntax Directed Operation">
  <!-- Prompt present in all requests to make a syntax-directed operation. SDOs are methods of the class `ParseNode` and therefore always have `self` argument. -->
  Every syntax-directed operation begins with a match against a Production. If `self` matches the production, some algorithm is performed. If `self` does not match the production, the function returns `NotImplemented`.

  Whenever the specification says "this production", take it as `self`. "This production" always refers to the `self` argument.
  To check if this production matches a `Production(...)` object, use `self.matches(Production(...))`.

  When comparing a string with a `Terminal`, check its `value` field, that is `STRING == TERMINAL.value`. Also, when checking if a `Terminal` is a member of string collection, use `TERMINAL.value in COLLECTION`.
  When comparing a string with a `Nonterminal`, use `javascript_grammar.matches(STRING, NONTERMINAL)`.
  When comparing a `Terminal` with a `Nonterminal`, use `javascript_grammar.matches(TERMINAL.value, NONTERMINAL)`.
  When the specification says "`StringValue` of XXX is a Nonterminal('ReservedWord')", use `lexical_grammar.matches(XXX.StringValue(), Nonterminal('ReservedWord'))`.
  When comparing two `Terminal`s, use comparison operator: `TERMINAL1 == TERMINAL2`.
  When comparing two `Nonterminal`s, use comparison operator: `NONTERMINAL1 == NONTERMINAL2`;

  Whenever the specification says that some non-string object X "is" a Nonterminal YYY, take it as `X.matches(Nonterminal('YYY'))`.
  Whenever the specification says that some non-string object X "is matched by" a Nonterminal YYY, take it as `X.matches(Nonterminal('YYY'))`.

  When other rules don't apply, take "Nonterminal('NAME')" as `self.get_subtree(Nonterminal('NAME'))`.
  When other rules don't apply, take "Nth Nonterminal('NAME')" as `self.get_subtree(Nonterminal('NAME'), N)` where N is the number starting from 1. "First" means 1, "second" means 2, etc.
  When other rules don't apply, take "this Nonterminal('NAME')" as `self.get_subtree(Nonterminal('NAME'), 0)`.
  When other rules don't apply, take "a Nonterminal('NAME1') that is covered by Nonterminal('NAME2')" as `self.get_subtree(Nonterminal('NAME2')).get_subtree(Nonterminal('NAME1'))`.

  Whenever the specification says "&lt;method&gt; `METHOD` of Nonterminal('NAME')" possibly with arguments ARGS, take it as `SUBTREE.METHOD(ARGS)` where SUBTREE is an object obtained through `self.get_subtree(...)` as in one of the rules above.
  Whenever the specification says "( [ PARAM ] ) parameter was set" or "this production has ( [ PARAM ] ) parameter", take it as `self.has_param(PARAM)`.
  To check if a "Nonterminal('NAME') is present", use `self.has_subtree(Nonterminal('NAME'))`.
  To obtain source text of some object, use method `source()`.
  To get all items matching Nonterminal('AAA') contained within Nonterminal('BBB'), use iteration: `for item in self.get_subtree(Nonterminal('BBB')).get_all_subtrees(Nonterminal('AAA'))`

  Whenever the specification says "`VARIABLE` is not present", test it as `VARIABLE is None`. Similarly "`VARIABLE` is present" means `VARIABLE is not None`.

  Whenever the specification says "‚ÄúCOLUMN_NAME‚Äù column of Table NUMBER", take it as `Table_NUMBER`. Such tables contain lists of properties. To check if a VALUE matches them iterate like `any(VALUE.matches(_property["COLUMN_NAME"]) for _property in Table_NUMBER)`.
  When the spec says about "Table 66" just iterate over `[_row[COLUMN_NAME] for _row in Table_66]`.
  When the spec says about "Table 67" just iterate over `[_row[COLUMN_NAME] for _row in Table_67]`.

 <prompt context="Early Errors">
  <!--
   Prompt present in all requests to make an "early errors" sub-procedure (a syntax-directed operation). These methods have `self` and `goal` arguments.
   If the `self` parse node does not match any production, it should return `NotImplemented`.
  -->
  The `goal` argument is of type Nonterminal.
  To check if a VALUE is some Unicode code point matched by the Nonterminal('XXX') lexical grammar production, use `lexical_grammar.matches(chr(VALUE), Nonterminal('XXX'))`.
  To check if a character value VALUE is the numeric value of some code point matched by the Nonterminal('NONTERMINAL') lexical grammar production, use `lexical_grammar.matches(chr(VALUE), Nonterminal('XXX'))`.
  To check if a goal symbol of the syntactic grammar is some nonterminal, compare the `goal` argument with the nonterminal using equality operator `==`.
  Whenever the specification says "It is a Syntax Error if ...", test if the condition is met and raise `SyntaxError("SPEC_LINE")` if so. Put the error specification as SPEC_LINE, starting from "It is a Syntax Error...". Escape quote characters inside the string.
  The phrase "any source text is matched by this production" always evaluates to true.
  To check if the source text is being processed by a direct eval use `execution_context_stack[-1].is_direct_eval()`.

  To perform an implementation-defined debugging action, call the function `debug` (like: `result = debug()`) and then return the completion record `Completion(result)`.

  Never return `CompletionRecord(Type=Enum_['normal'], Value=NotImplemented)`, just return `NotImplemented`.

  The list of all internal method names is in global variable `all_internal_methods`. The list of essential internal methods is in global variable `essential_internal_methods`.
  To check if an object OBJ has a property PROP, use `PROP in OBJ`.

  To test if a VALUE is a Private Name, use `isinstance(VALUE, PrivateName)`.
  The the surrounding agent 's Agent Record can be obtained from the global variable `agent_record`.
  `GlobalSymbolRegistry` is a global variable.
